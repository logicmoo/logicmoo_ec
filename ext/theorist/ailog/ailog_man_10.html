<h2>6.3 Depth Bound</h2>
<p>The search strategy used by AILog is a depth-bounded depth-first search.
The depth bound is set using the command:<a name="id1"></a>
</p>
<pre>
ailog: <b>bound </b><em>n</em>.
</pre>
<p>where <em>n</em> is a positive integer. n is a bound on the depth of any proof tree. The default value is 30.
</p>
<p>When a goal is asked and
no more answers can be found, if the depth-bound was not reached, the
system reports there are no more answers. If the depth-bound was
reached, there still may be some answers, although it is more
likely that there is a bug in the knowledge base where some recursions
do not terminate. AILog allows the user to interactively explore
the places where the depth bound was reached.
</p>
<p>When no more answers can be found and the search was cut off due to
hitting the depth-bound, the user is informed of this, as is given
the option of
one of:
</p>
<dl><dt>i.</dt><dd> where i is an integer bigger than the current
depth-bound. This lets the user explore larger search trees.
Repeatedly increasing the depth-bound lets the user simulate an
iterative deepening search.
</dd><dt>where.</dt><dd> to let the user explore the place where the depth-bound was reached.
</dd><dt>ok.</dt><dd> to go back to the answer prompt.
</dd><dt>help.</dt><dd> for a list of the available commands.
</dd></dl>
<p>When the user given the <b>where</b> command, the proof is retried,
and it halts at a point where the depth-bound was reached, and shows
the user the current subgoal, g. The user can give one of the
following commands:
</p>
<dl><dt>fail.</dt><dd> to fail g, and explore other places where the depth-bound was reached.
</dd><dt>succeed.</dt><dd> to say that g should succeed.
</dd><dt>proceed.</dt><dd> to fail g and not explore any more subgoals where the depth-bound was reached.
</dd><dt>why.</dt><dd> to let the user explore why g was called (see Section <a href="ailog_man_11.html">6.4</a>).
</dd><dt>ok.</dt><dd> to go back to the answer prompt.
</dd><dt>help.</dt><dd> for a list of the available commands.
</dd></dl>
