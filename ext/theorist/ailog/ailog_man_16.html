<h1>11 Probabilities</h1>
<p>AILog contains support for first-order probabilistic reasoning. You
can have probabilities associated with atoms that have no associated
rules defining them. There atoms are grouped into disjoint sets that
correspond to random variables.
</p>
<p>You can define these probabilistic assumptions using either:
</p>
<pre>
ailog: <b>prob </b><em>atom</em>:<em>probability</em>.
</pre>
<p>where <em>atom</em> is a atomic symbol and <em>probability</em> is a
number between 0 and 1. <em>atom</em> can contain variables, in which
case every ground instance is a proposition with the corresponding
probability. All instances of the same atom, and all atoms defined in
different <em>prob</em> declarations are assumed to be probabilistically
independent. 
</p>
<p>The alternative syntax is to write:
</p>
<div class="quotation">
ailog: <b>prob </b>a<sub>1</sub>:p1, a<sub>2</sub>:p<sub>2</sub>, ..., a<sub>k</sub>:p<sub>k</sub>.
</div>
<p>Where the p<sub>i</sub> are non-negative numbers that sum to 1 and the a<sub>i</sub>
are atoms that share the same variables. In this case every ground
instantiation of the a<sub>i</sub>s forms a random variable: the a<sub>i</sub>s are
mutually exclusive and covering.
</p>
<p>The atoms defined in a <em>prob</em> statement cannot be used in the
head of rules, but can be used in the body. When called, the instance
of these atoms must be ground.
</p>
<p>We also allow statements where the probability is free, for example
in:
</p>
<pre>
ailog: <b>prob </b>heads_happens(E,P):P.
</pre>
<p>This is useful when we want to learn parameters from
observations. Note that when this is called, P must be bound.
</p>
<p>There are two main interfaces to the probabilistic reasoning:
</p>
<pre>
ailog: <b>observe </b><em>obs</em>.
</pre>
<p>where <i>obs</i> is a body.
This declares that <em>obs</em> has been observed. This returns the
probability of <em>obs</em> conditioned on all previous
observations. Observations accumulate, so that
subsequent queries and observations are with respect to all previous
observations. 
</p>
<p>You can ask the posterior probability of a query (this is the
conditional probability given all of the current observations) using:
</p>
<pre>
ailog: <b>predict </b><em>query</em>.
</pre>
<p>where <i>query</i> is a body.
This gives the posterior probability of <em>query</em>, conditioned 
on all previous observations.
</p>
<p>Given any prediction or observations you can inspect the explanations
of the query. An explanation corresponds to a proof of the query based
on a set of the probabilistic atoms. For each of these explanations
you can examine the proof tree, and ask how that explanation was
computed. This can either be done after a proof, or as a stand-alone
command:
</p>
<pre>
ailog: <b>explanations.</b>
</pre>
<p>which returns the explanations of all of the observations.
</p>
<p>You can also ask for the worlds in which the query and all of the
previous explanations are true. This gives a set of descriptions of
possible worlds where the possible worlds are described in terms of the
probabilistic atoms that are true in them, and the descriptions are
mutually exclusive. This can be used form computing the probability of
the query (by summing over all of the worlds where it is true). The
worlds are computed from the explanations by making sure that they are
mutually exclusive. This can either be done after a prediction or
observation or by issuing the command
</p>
<pre>
ailog: <b>worlds.</b>
</pre>
<p>Which returns the worlds in which all of the observations are true.
</p>
<p>Note that the <b>ask</b> command ignores all previous
observations. A future version may allow you to ask in the context of
previous explanations.
</p>
<p>You can undo observations using
</p>
<pre>
ailog: <b>unobserve.</b>
</pre>
<p>which undoes the last observation or using
</p>
<pre>
ailog: <b>unobserve all.</b>
</pre>
<p>which undoes all observations.
</p>
<p>The command 
</p>
<pre>
ailog: <b>probs.</b>
</pre>
<p>lists all probabilistic assertions.
</p>
<p>Note that probabilities integrates cleanly with negation as failure and
naively with the depth-bounded search. (It fails if the probability
cannot be computed due to the depth-bound. A more sophisticated
version may give bounds on the probability.) Probabilistic hypotheses
and non-probabilistic hypotheses (using <em>assumable</em>) are not
integrated and should not be used together.
</p>
<div class="quotation"><b>Example.</b>
<i><a name="tell-ex2">
This</a> may seem like not a very powerful probabilistic inference system,
however, arbitrary Bayesian belief nets can be represented. For example, a
belief network with Boolean variable A as a parent of variable B
can be represented as:
<pre>
ailog: <b>tell b &lt;- a &amp; bifa.</b>
ailog: <b>tell b &lt;- ~a &amp; bifna.</b>
ailog: <b>prob a:0.6.</b>
ailog: <b>prob bifa:0.9.</b>
ailog: <b>prob bifna:0.3.</b>
</pre>
<p>You can ask the prior on a using:
</p>
<pre>
ailog: <b>predict a.</b>
Answer: P(a|Obs)=0.6.
 Runtime since last report: 0.03 secs.
  [ok,more,explanations,worlds,help]: ok.
</pre>
<p>And conditioning on &nbsp;b.
</p>
<pre>
ailog: <b>observe ~b.</b>
Answer: P(~b|Obs)=0.34.
 Runtime since last report: 0 secs.
  [ok,more,explanations,worlds,help]: <b>ok.</b>
ailog: <b>predict a.</b>
Answer: P(a|Obs)=0.176471.
 Runtime since last report: 0 secs.
  [ok,more,explanations,worlds,help]:<b> ok.</b>
ailog: 
  </pre>
<p>Thus P(a | &nbsp;b) = 0.176471.

</div>
<p>Note that Ailog does not find all explanations, but only those within
a threshold. This threshold can be queried and varied with the
<code>prob_threshold</code> command.
