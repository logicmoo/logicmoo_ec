<h2>11.1 Experimental Probabilistic Features</h2>
<p>The features in this section are only for specialized applications and
may be changed in future applications. Do not use these unless you
know what you are doing.
</p>
<p>Sometimes we may observe arbitrary choices that we don't want to model
the probability of. For example, that the rooms in an apartment
are r<sub>17</sub>, r<sub>53</sub> and r<sub>5</sub>. We may have a probability that there
are three, but the names may be arbitrary. Once these have been
observed, then queries about what are the rooms should return
these. 
</p>
<p>As another example, we may want to count rooms. Which is the
first room and which is the second room is arbitrary, but we have to
record which ones we have already counted so we don't count them
again. We don't want to search
over the choices of which is first and which is second. 
</p>
<pre>
ailog: <b>arbitrary </b>f=V.
</pre>
<p>means that the values V assigned to f are arbitrary, but f can
only have one such value. Note that f=V can be used as any other
atom.
The command <code>arbitraries</code> list all of the arbitrary declarations.
