<h2>6.1 How? Questions</h2>
<p>When the system has derived an answer you can ask <b>how</b><a name="id1"> that</a>
answer was produced. This provides a mechanism for interactively
traversing a proof tree.  At each stage the system either says why
the answer was produced immediately (e.g., if it was a fact or a
built-in predicate -- see Section <a href="ailog_man_13.html">8</a>) or produces the
instance of the top-level rule that was used to prove the goal.
</p>
<p>When you ask how atom h was proved, it produces the instance of the
rule in the knowledge base with h as the head that succeeded:
</p>
<pre>
h &lt;-
   1: a&#95;1
   2: a&#95;2
   ...
   k: a&#95;k
</pre>
<p>which indicates that the rule h  &lt;- a<sub>1</sub> &#38; a<sub>2</sub> &#38; ...&#38; a<sub>k</sub> was used to prove h. You can then give one of:
</p>
<dl><dt>how i.</dt><dd> where i is an integer 1  &lt;= i  &lt;= k. This means that you want to see how a<sub>i</sub> was proved.
</dd><dt>up.</dt><dd> to go back to see the rule with h in the body. If h is the initial query it goes back to the answer interaction.
</dd><dt>retry.</dt><dd> to ask for a different proof tree.
</dd><dt>ok.</dt><dd> to exit the how traversal and go back to the answer prompt.
</dd><dt>help.</dt><dd> for a list of the available commands.
</dd></dl>
<p>If a<sub>i</sub> was not proved via a rule (for example, if it was a fact or
a built-in predicate), the reason that a<sub>i</sub> was proved is printed
and then the rule with a<sub>i</sub> in the body is printed again.
</p>

Given the knowledge base after Example <a href="ailog_man_5.html#tell-ex">4</a>, you can ask how a particular instance of the query was proved, as in:
<pre>
