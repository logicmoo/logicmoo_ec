<h2>6.2 Whynot? Questions</h2>
<p>Just as how questions let you explore the proof tree for a particular
derivation, <b>whynot</b><a name="id1"> questions</a> let you explore the
search tree. This facility is mainly used for determining why there
was no proof for a particular query. As such the documentation is
written assuming that you are trying to determine why a query failed,
when you thought that it should have succeeded.
</p>
<p>If a query fails when it should have succeeded, either there was
a rule defining the query whose body fails when it should have
succeeded, or else there is a missing rule for that query.
</p>
<p>You can ask a query to determine why some query failed using:<a name="id2"></a>
</p>
<pre>
ailog: <b>whynot </b><em>query</em>.
</pre>
<p>where <i>query</i> is a body.
</p>
<p>If the query is an atom, you can examine each rule whose head unifies
with the query. For each such rule, the system asks whether you want
to trace this rule. You can reply with:
</p>
<dl><dt>yes.</dt><dd> to determine why this rule failed. You should give this
answer when this rule should have succeeded for this query.
</dd><dt>no.</dt><dd> to ask for another rule. You give this answer if this rule should have failed for this query.
</dd><dt>up.</dt><dd> to return to a previous choice point (the rule in which the atom appears, or else the top-level if the atom was the initial query).
</dd><dt>ok.</dt><dd> to return to the top-level.
</dd><dt>help.</dt><dd> to get a menu of available answers.
</dd></dl>
<p>If you answer "<b>no</b>" to each rule, this means that all of the rules in the knowledge base should have failed, and so the appropriate rule for the query that should have succeeded is missing.
</p>
<p>To determine why a rule failed, we determine why the body failed. If
the body is atomic, we use the above <em>whynot</em> mechanism to
determine why the rule failed.  If the body of the rule is a
conjunction, alpha<code>&amp;</code>beta, there are four cases:
</p>
<ul><li>alpha fails, in which case we should use recursively use
the <em>whynot</em> mechanism to determine why it failed.
</li><li>an instance of alpha succeeds, but should not have succeeded.
In this case we can use the <em>how</em> mechanism to debug this proof.
This case arises because beta may have rightfully failed on the
instance of alpha that succeeded.
</li><li>an instance of alpha succeeds, but this instance should have
lead to failure of the conjunction. In this case we should look for
another proof for alpha.
</li><li>an instance of alpha succeeds that should lead to the success
of the conjunction, in which case we need to determine why beta
failed on this instance.
</li></ul>
<p>Thus, when there is a conjunctive body, we first try to prove the
leftmost conjunct. If it fails, we use the above <em>whynot</em>
mechanism to determine why it failed. If it succeeds, the user is
asked <em>Should this answer lead to a successful proof?</em> The user
can reply:
</p>
<dl><dt>yes.</dt><dd> this instance should have made the body succeed. Thus you need
to debug the rest of the conjunction.
</dd><dt>no.</dt><dd> this instance should lead to a failure of the body. Thus you need to try
another proof for this atom.
</dd><dt>debug.</dt><dd> this instance is false, debug it. This enters the
<em>how</em> interaction.
</dd><dt>ok.</dt><dd> to return to the top-level.
</dd><dt>help.</dt><dd> to get a menu of available answers.
</dd></dl>
<div class="quotation"><b>Example.</b>
<i>
Suppose we had the knowledge base from Example <a href="ailog_man_5.html#tell-ex">4</a>. Suppose
that, the user knew that Joe had a child called Jane, and wanted to
know why the system didn't think that Randy was Jane's grandfather.
We could imagine the following dialogue:
<pre>
ailog: <b>whynot grandfather(randy,jane). </b>
  grandfather(randy,jane) &lt;- father(randy,A)&amp;parent(A,jane).
    Trace this rule? [yes,no,up,help]: <b>yes.</b>
  The proof for father(randy,sally) succeeded.
   Should this answer lead to a successful proof? 
               [yes,no,debug,help]: <b>no.</b>
  The proof for father(randy,joe) succeeded.
   Should this answer lead to a successful proof? 
               [yes,no,debug,help]: <b>yes.</b>
  parent(joe,jane) &lt;- mother(joe,jane).
    Trace this rule? [yes,no,up,help]: <b>no.</b>
  parent(joe,jane) &lt;- father(joe,jane).
    Trace this rule? [yes,no,up,help]: <b>yes.</b>
  There is no applicable rule for father(joe,jane).
  parent(joe,jane) &lt;- father(joe,jane).
    Trace this rule? [yes,no,up,help]: <b>up.</b>
  grandfather(randy,jane) &lt;- father(randy,joe)&amp;parent(joe,jane).
    Trace this rule? [yes,no,up,help]: <b>up.</b>
