% two blocks can't be on the same block at the same time
constraint loc(B)=loc(B1) ->> loc(B)=table where B @< B1.

% definition of above

caused above(B,L) if loc(B)=L.
caused above(B,L) if loc(B)=B1 & above(B1,L).
default -above(B,L).

% a block cannot be above itself
constraint -above(B,B).

% effect of moving a block
move(B) causes loc(B)=L if destination(B)=L.

% a block can be moved only when it is clear
nonexecutable move(B) if loc(B1)=B.

% a block can't be moved onto a block that is being moved also
nonexecutable move(B) & move(B1) if destination(B)=B1.

% a block can't be moved to its current position
nonexecutable move(B) if destination(B)=loc(B).
