2.3. Counting Bullets
</h2>
</center>

In the original formalization of the Yale Shooting Problem
(<a href="ysp.html">Section 2.1</a>) the gun is assumed to hold at most one
bullet--it becomes unloaded after shooting.  Let us consider a more general
case when the number of bullets in the gun is an integer
between 0 and a fixed upper bound.  This number goes up by 1 after
loading, and goes down by 1 after shooting.<p>

Here is a possible formalization of the modified domain:

<pre>
:- macros
 capacity -> 6;
 loaded -> (numberOfBullets>0).

:- constants
 alive :: inertialFluent;
 numberOfBullets :: inertialFluent(0..capacity);
 load, shoot :: exogenousAction.

:- variables
 I :: 0..capacity.

load causes numberOfBullets=I+1 if numberOfBullets=I
    where I&lt;capacity.
nonexecutable load if numberOfBullets=capacity.

shoot causes -alive.
shoot causes numberOfBullets=I-1 if numberOfBullets=I
    where I&gt;0.
nonexecutable shoot if -loaded.

nonexecutable load & shoot.
</pre>

In the new formalization, we defined <tt>loaded</tt> as a macro, rather
than an action constant.  (The two macro definitions are combined here
under one <tt>:-&nbsp;macros</tt> heading, separated from each other by a
semicolon.)  In the presence of this definition, CCalc expands the line

<pre>
nonexecutable shoot if -loaded
</pre>

into

<pre>
nonexecutable shoot if -(numberOfBullets>0).
</pre>

Then it eliminates the symbol <tt>&gt;</tt> from this proposition.  This is
done in two steps.  First, the proposition is rewritten as the schematic
proposition

<p><tt>nonexecutable shoot
  if numberOfBullets=</tt><i>var</i> <tt>&amp; -(</tt><i>var</i>&gt;0)</tt><p>

where <i>var</i> is a variable ranging over the domain <tt>0..capacity</tt>
of the constant <tt>numberOfBullets</tt>.  Then this schematic proposition is
grounded and, in every ground instance, <i>var</i>&gt;0</tt> is replaced
by <tt>true</tt> or by <tt>false</tt> depending on the value of <i>var</i>.<p>

Note the <tt>where</tt> clauses appended to two schematic propositions in the
example above.  In the proposition describing the effect of <tt>load</tt> on
<tt>numberOfBullets</tt>
we would like <tt>I</tt> to range over <tt>0..capacity-1</tt>; in the
proposition describing the effect of <tt>shoot</tt> on this fluent, we would
like <tt>I</tt> to range over <tt>1..capacity</tt>.  Instead of using two
different variables, we declared <tt>I</tt> to be a variable for all numbers
in the interval <tt>0..capacity</tt>, but instructed CCalc not to use the
"bad" values of <tt>I</tt> in the process of grounding the schematic
propositions containing that variable.  The clause
<pre>
where I&lt;capacity
</pre>
appended to the schematic proposition
<pre>
load causes numberOfBullets=I+1 if numberOfBullets=I
</pre>
tells CCalc that the value <tt>capacity</tt> should not be substituted
for <tt>I</tt> when that proposition is grounded.  Similarly, the clause
<pre>
where I&gt;0
</pre>
tells CCalc not to use the value <tt>0</tt>.<p>

<b>Exercise 2.7.</b>
What do you think will happen if you remove one of the <tt>where</tt> clauses
from the formalization of the shooting domain above and then instruct CCalc to
<tt>loadf</tt> the modified version?  Check that your conjecture is correct.<p>

<b>Exercise 2.8.</b>
Recall that file <a href="coins"><tt>coins</tt></a> describes the action 
of putting a coin in the box.  That action is not executable if the box is
full.  Consider the extension of that domain that includes also a second
action -- putting two coins in the box.  That action is not executable if the
box is full or "nearly full."  Represent this extension in the language of
CCalc using only one variable.<p>

The conditions on the values of variables used in <tt>where</tt> clauses are
called <i>tests</i>.  In a test, variables ranging over subsets of integers
and their values (such as <tt>0</tt> and <tt>capacity</tt>) can be combined
using symbols for arithmetical operations<p>

<center>
<tt>+</tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>-</tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>*</tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>//</tt>
</center>

<p>(the last is integer division).  Atomic tests can be formed from
arithmetical expressions using equality and the negation of equality<p>

<center>
<tt>=</tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>\=</tt>
</center>

<p> and order relations<p>

<center>
<tt>&lt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;=&lt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;=</tt>
</center><p>

Atomic tests can be further combined into complex tests using
propositional connectives<p>

<center>
<tt>-</tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>&</tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>++</tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<tt>-&gt;&gt;</tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>&lt;-&gt;</tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</center>

<p>(the last two are material implication and equivalence).
Tests are a special case of formulas of the kind
that we see, for instance, after <tt>if</tt> in propositions.  What is special
about tests is that they do not contain fluent symbols, so that they can be
evaluated in the process of grounding.<p>
