<h2>
3.2. Families of Fluents, Actions and Objects
</h2>
</center>

Many action domains involve parameterized families of fluents and actions,
rather than individual fluents and actions as in the examples discussed in
this tutorial so far.  For instance, in the blocks world
(<a href="objects.html">Section 3.1</a>), a configuration of blocks can be
described by a family of fluents -- the location-valued fluents
<tt>loc(B)</tt>, where <tt>B</tt> is an object of sort <tt>block</tt>.
Actions in this domain are <tt>move(B,L)</tt> ("move block <tt>B</tt> to
location <tt>L</tt>"); this is a family of actions with two parameters.
Here is how these families can be declared in the language of CCalc:

<pre>
:- constants
 loc(block)           :: inertialFluent(location);
 move(block,location) :: exogenousAction.
</pre>

After that, expressions such as <tt>loc(a)</tt> and <tt>loc(B)</tt> can be
used as names of fluents (here <tt>a</tt> is an object of sort <tt>block</tt>,
and <tt>B</tt> is a variable for blocks), and similarly for actions.  For
instance, the effect of moving blocks can be described by the schematic
proposition

<pre>
move(B,L) causes loc(B)=L.
</pre>

As another example, consider the enhancement of the shooting domain from
<a href="ysp.html">Section 2.1</a> in which there are two potential targets,
Turkey 1 and Turkey 2, and the effect of shooting depends on how the gun is
aimed (<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/vl/papers/nmct.ps">NMCT</a>,
Section 5.1</tt>).  The CCalc representation of that domain shown in file
<a href="../examples/nmct/turkeys">turkeys</a> declares the family of fluents
<tt>alive(turkey)</tt> and the family of actions <tt>aim(turkey)</tt>.<p>

In this example, an interesting problem arises in connection with the fluent
<tt>target</tt>, which describes how the gun is aimed.  Its values are objects
of sort <tt>turkey</tt>.  But we want to allow the gun not to be aimed at any
target at all; this is what happens immediately after loading.  How can we
declare such a "partially defined fluent"?  Technically, this is accomplished
by including the special symbol <tt>none</tt> in the set of its possible
values.  The
supersort mechanism, described in <a href="objects.html">Section 3.1</a>,
can be used to introduce an auxiliary sort that can be referred to in the
declaration of <tt>target</tt>:

<pre>
:- sorts
 aux >> turkey.

:- objects
 none    :: aux.

:- constants
 target  :: inertialFluent(aux).
</pre>

But adding <tt>none</tt> to a sort is such a useful operation that the
language of CCalc provides special, more compact syntax for it.  In
file <a href="../examples/nmct/turkeys">turkeys</a> we simply write:

<pre>
:- sorts
  turkey.

:- constants
  target  :: inertialFluent(turkey+none).
</pre>

The query at the end of file <a href="../examples/nmct/turkeys">turkeys</a>
contains a variable:

<pre>
:- query
maxstep :: 5..6;
0: alive(T),
   target=none,
   -loaded;
maxstep:
  -alive(T).
</pre>

Variables in queries are understood to be universally quantified,
so that this query has the same meaning as

<pre>
:- query
 maxstep :: 5..6;
 0: alive(turkey1) & alive(turkey2),
    target=none,
    -loaded;
 maxstep: -alive(turkey1) & -alive(turkey2).
</pre>

The implicit universal quantifier over <tt>T</tt> can be also shown explicitly:

<pre>
:- query
 maxstep :: 5..6;
 0: [/\T | alive(T)],
    target=none,
    -loaded;
 maxstep: [/\T | -alive(T)].
</pre>

If we replaced the universal quantifier <tt>/\</tt> (that is to say, multiple
conjunction) in the last line with the existential quantifier (multiple
disjunction) <tt>\/</tt> and wrote

<pre>
 maxstep: [\/T | -alive(T)]
</pre>

then the goal would be to kill at least one turkey.  To express that the
goal is to kill exactly one turkey, we can write

<pre>
maxstep: [\/ T /\ T1 | alive(T1) <-> T=T1]
</pre>
where <tt>T1</tt> is another variable of sort <tt>turkey</tt>.
<p>

The answer to the query produced by CCalc begins with the lines

<pre>
0:  alive(turkey1)  alive(turkey2)  

ACTIONS:  load  

1:  loaded  alive(turkey1)  alive(turkey2)

ACTIONS:  aim(turkey1)  

2:  loaded  alive(turkey1)  alive(turkey2)  target=turkey1  
</pre>

Note that, in the output of CCalc, the value of <tt>target</tt> is shown in
state 2, but not in states 0 and 1.  This is because CCalc does not
display the value of a fluent when that value is <tt>none</tt>, in
accordance with the interpretation of that value as "undefined."<p>

<b>Exercise 3.2.</b>
Consider the modification of the domain from file
<a href="../examples/nmct/turkeys">turkeys</a> in which two hunters with guns
(<tt>mygun</tt> and <tt>hisgun</tt>) pursue three animals (<tt>buffalo</tt>,
<tt>deer</tt> and <tt>fox</tt>).  Initially the
guns are loaded but not aimed, and the goal is to kill all three animals.
Use CCalc to find a solution.<p>

<b>Exercise 3.3.</b>
John and Mary from Problem 3.1 (<a href="objects.html">Section 3.1</a>)
have three coins: a penny, a nickel and a dime.  Besides giving coins to
each other, they can also throw them away.  All coins are currently in
Mary's possession.  John wants to have exctly two coins, and he wants Mary
to have nothing.  Instruct CCalc to suggest an appropriate course of action.<p>

If we want to talk about 100 turkeys, instead of two, the declaration

<pre>
:- objects 
  turkey1, turkey2    :: turkey.
</pre>

in file <a href="../examples/nmct/turkeys">turkeys</a> will become much
longer.  An alternative is to replace the individually declared objects
<tt>turkey1</tt>, <tt>turkey2</tt>, etc., by a family of objects indexed
by numbers:

<pre>
:- sorts
  index; turkey.

:- objects 
  1..100               :: index;
  t(index)             :: turkey.
</pre><p>

<b>Exercise 3.4.</b>
Modify your solution to Exercise 3.2 to include 5 guns.<p>
