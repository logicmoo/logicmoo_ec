1.4. How CCalc Does It
</h2>
</center>

The operation of CCalc in the example from
<a href="running.html">Section 1.3</a> and in similar cases can be summarized
as follows.  In response to the <tt>loadf</tt> command, CCalc produces a
description of the given transition system in the form of a set of clauses.
In response to the <tt>query</tt> command, CCalc turns the given query
into a set of clauses and invokes a SAT solver to find a solution.<p>

We will now discuss each of these two steps in some detail.<p>

<i>Describing a transition system by a set of clauses</i>.
Take, for instance, transition system
<a href="transitionsystems.html#boolean"><i>TS1</i></a> from Section 0.1.
If we create a file containing the
<a href="input1.html#boolean">CCalc description</a> of this system given in
Section 1.1 and <tt>loadf</tt> that file, then we'll able to display the
clauses produced by CCalc using the command

<pre>
| ?- show_clauses.
</pre>
(Try it!)  We'll see 3 clauses on the screen:

<pre>
-(0:a) ++ 1:p.
-(1:p) ++ 0:p ++ 0:a.
-(0:p) ++ 1:p.
</pre>

(In the language of CCalc, <tt>-</tt> is negation and <tt>++</tt> is
disjunction.)  The assignments of truth values to the atoms 0:<i>p</i>,
0:<i>a</i> and 1:<i>p</i> that satisfy these clauses exactly correspond to
the edges of the given
transition system.  For instance, mapping 0:<i>p</i> to <b>f</b> and
1:<i>p</i>, 0:<i>a</i> to <b>t</b> corresponds to the horizontal edge
from <i>p</i>=<b>f</b> to <i>p</i>=<b>t</b> labeled <i>a</i>=<b>t</b>.<p>

The clauses formed by CCalc are propositional, that is to say, their atoms
do not contain variables.  The variables occurring in schematic propositions,
such as <tt>I</tt> in file <a href="coins"><tt>coins</tt></a>, are eliminated
by grounding -- substituting all possible values for each variable -- prior to
turning propositions into clauses.<p>

Generating the clauses is accomplished by translating propositions
into causal rules and completing the rules, as described in Section&nbsp;2 of
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/vl/papers/nmct.ps">NMCT</a>, and
then clausifying the completion.
Information on the number of causal rules that have been produced is displayed
by CCalc in response to the <tt>loadf</tt> command, along with the number of
atoms occurring in the rules and the number of clauses obtained after
completion and clausification:

<pre>
% 3 atoms, 7 rules, 3 clauses
</pre>

The rules themselves can be displayed using the command

<pre>
| ?- show_rules.
</pre>

<i>Turning a query into a set of clauses</i>.  Once the value of
<tt>maxstep</tt>
is specified, CCalc generates a set of clauses representing the paths of
length <tt>maxstep</tt>.  In the example above, if the value of
<tt>maxstep</tt> in the query is 3, this set will consist of the clauses
produced earlier

<pre>
-(0:a) ++ 1:p.
-(1:p) ++ 0:p ++ 0:a.
-(0:p) ++ 1:p.
</pre>

and two "copies" of these clauses, with the "time stamps" 0, 1 incremented
first by 1 and then by 2:

<pre>
-(1:a) ++ 2:p.
-(2:p) ++ 1:p ++ 1:a.
-(1:p) ++ 2:p.

-(2:a) ++ 3:p.
-(3:p) ++ 2:p ++ 2:a.
-(2:p) ++ 3:p.
</pre>

The assignments of truth values to atoms that satisfy all 9 clauses are in
a 1-1 correspondence with the paths of length 3 in the given transition
system.  The process of forming copies of the initially generated clauses
by incrementing time stamps is called shifting.<p>

When the shifting process is completed, the resulting set of clauses is
extended by the conditions on the path that are included in the query, such
as assumptions about the initial values of fluents in
a prediction problem.   The assignments of truth values to atoms that satisfy
the extended set of clauses represent the answers to the query.  This extended
set is passed to a SAT solver to find an answer.<p>
