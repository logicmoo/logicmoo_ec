2.2. Nondeterministic Shooting
</h2>
</center>

In the Yale Shooting Problem (<a href="ysp.html">Section 2.1</a>) the person
is assumed to become dead any time he is shot with a loaded gun.  Let us
relax this assumption now and take into account the possibility that the
assailant can miss.  After shooting, the fluent <i>alive</i> can change its
value from <b>t</b> to <b>f</b>, as before, but it can also keep the value
<b>t</b>.  In terms of the transition system, this modification means that
one more edge is added to the graph.  The edge starts at the vertex<p>

<center>
<i>alive</i>=<b>t</b>,&nbsp;<i>loaded</i>=<b>t</b>,
</center>

<p>is labeled<p>

<center>
<i>load</i>=<b>f</b>,&nbsp;<i>shoot</i>=<b>t</b>
</center>

<p>and goes to the vertex<p>

<center>
<i>alive</i>=<b>t</b>,&nbsp;<i>loaded</i>=<b>f</b>.
</center>

<p>The modified transition system is nondeterministic, in the sense that it
contains a pair of different edges that start at the same vertex and have
the same label.<p>

This change can be reflected in the language of CCalc by replacing the
proposition

<pre>
shoot causes -alive
</pre>

in the original formalization of the shooting domain with

<pre>
shoot may cause -alive.
</pre>

<tt>may cause</tt> propositions, like <tt>causes</tt> propositions, can be
conditional (that is, followed by <tt>if</tt>...).<p>

<b>Exercise 2.6.</b>
In the modified domain, the assumptions of the Yale Shooting Problem
(the person is initially alive, then the gun is loaded, then he waits, and
then he is shot) entails neither that the fluent <i>alive</i> is true in
the final state nor that it is false.  Verify this assertion using CCalc.<p>

In the examples discussed so far in this tutorial we have seen CCalc
propositions of three kinds: <tt>causes</tt> propositions,
<tt>nonexecutable</tt> propositions and <tt>may cause</tt> propositions.
The reader familiar with action language C+ knows
that all these expressions are actually abbreviations for special kinds of
"fluent dynamic laws" (see
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/vl/papers/nmct.ps">NMCT</a>,
Appendix B). The general form of a fluent dynamic law is<p>

<center>
<tt>caused</tt> <i>F</i> <tt>if</tt> <i>G</i> <tt>after</tt> <i>H</i>
</center>

<p>where <i>F</i>, <i>G</i> and <i>H</i> are formulas; <i>F</i> and <i>G</i>
are not allowed to contain symbols for actions.  In particular,<p>

<center>
<i>A</i> <tt>causes</tt> <i>F</i> <tt>if</tt> <i>G</i>
</center>

<p>is shorthand for<p>

<center>
<tt>caused</tt> <i>F</i> <tt>if true</tt>
                         <tt>after</tt> <i>A</i> <tt>&</tt> <i>G</i>
</center>

<p>("there is a cause for <i>F</i> to hold after the execution of action
<i>A</i> in a state satisfying condition <i>G</i>").  The proposition<p>

<center>
<tt>nonexecutable</tt> <i>A</i> <tt>if</tt> <i>F</i>
</center>

<p>is shorthand for<p>

<center>
<tt>caused false if true after</tt> <i>A</i> <tt>&</tt> <i>F</i>.
</center>

<p>The proposition<p>

<center>
<i>A</i> <tt>may cause</tt> <i>F</i> <tt>if</tt> <i>G</i>
</center>

<p>is expanded into<p>

<center>
<tt>caused</tt> <i>F</i> <tt>if</tt> <i>F</i>
                         <tt>after</tt> <i>A</i> <tt>&</tt> <i>G.</i>
</center>

<p>-- if <i>F</i> holds after the execution of action <i>A</i> in a state
satisfying condition <i>G</i> then there is a cause for this.  In other
words, <i>F</i> is a possible outcome of <i>A</i>; <i>F</i> is allowed to
become true after executing <i>A</i>, but this outcome is not required.<p>

The reader familiar with C+ knows also that there is no syntactic
category of "inertial fluents" in that language.  The syntax of C+
distinguishes between two kinds of fluent constants -- simple and
statically determined.  If <i>C</i> is a simple fluent constant then<p>

<center>
<tt>inertial</tt> <i>C</i>
</center>

<p>is shorthand for the set of fluent dynamic laws<p>

<center>
<tt>caused</tt> <i>C=V</i> <tt>if</tt> <i>C=V</i> <tt>after</tt> <i>C=V</i>
</center>

<p>for all possible values <i>V</i> of <i>C</i>: if <i>C</i> has
now the same value <i>V</i> that it had before then there
is a cause for this.  (Intuitively, inertia is the cause; this is how
fluent dynamic laws solve the frame problem.)  These fluent dynamic laws
are similar to those obtained by expanding  <tt>may cause</tt> propositions:
they also have the form
<tt>caused</tt>&nbsp;<i>F</i>&nbsp;<tt>if</tt>&nbsp;<i>F</i>&nbsp;<tt>after</tt>&nbsp;...&nbsp;.<p>

In accordance with this understanding of inertial fluents, an
<tt>inertialFluent</tt> declaration in CCalc code is an abbreviation for a
<tt>simpleFluent</tt> declaration combined with an <tt>inertial</tt>
proposition.  For instance, the declaration

<pre>
:- constants
 c :: inertialFluent(0..n).
</pre>

has the same meaning as

<pre>
:- constants
 c :: simpleFluent(0..n).

inertial c.
