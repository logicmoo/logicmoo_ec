1.5. Setting Parameters
</h2>
</center>

CCalc can use several SAT solvers.  By default, it calls mChaff and
instructs it to stop as soon as one solution has been computed.  Choices
like these are determined by the values of parameters that can be changed by
the user.  The default values of these parameters are stored in the file
<tt>options.std</tt> in the CCalc directory.  To see their current values,
type <tt>show_parameters</tt>:

<pre>
| ?- show_parameters.

    solver = mchaff
    solver_opts(mchaff) = ''
    num = 1
    file_io = true
    timed = true
    verbose = true
    compact = false
    optimize = true
    eliminate_tautologies = true
</pre>

To see the list of solvers that can be called by CCalc, type
<tt>help(solver)</tt>:

<pre>
| ?- help(solver).

   The "solver" option establishes which satisfiability solver CCalc will
   call.  Valid values are:

   grasp      -- GRASP, Feb. 2000 version, by Joao Marques Silva
   mchaff     -- mChaff version spelt3, by Matthew Moskewicz
   relsat     -- relsat version 2.00, by Roberto Bayardo
   relsat_old -- relsat version 1.1.2, by Roberto Bayardo
   sato       -- SATO version 3.2, by Hantao Zhang
   sato_old   -- SATO version 3.1.2, by Hantao Zhang
   satz       -- Satz215.2, by Chu-Min Li
   satz-rand  -- satz-rand 4.9, by Henry Kautz
   walksat    -- WalkSAT version 41, by Henry Kautz and Bart Selman
   zchaff     -- zChaff, by Lintao Zhang
</pre>

The values of parameters can be changed by the <tt>set</tt> command, for
instance:

<pre>
| ?- set(solver,grasp).

yes
| ?- show_parameters.

    solver = grasp
    solver_opts = ''
    num = 1

| ?- set(num,all).

yes
| ?- show_parameters.

    solver = grasp
    solver_opts = ''
    num = all
</pre>

By assigning value <tt>all</tt> to parameter <tt>num</tt>, the user instructs
CCalc to find all answers to the query.  If a positive integer <i>n</i> is
assigned to <tt>num</tt>, CCalc will stop after generating <i>n</i> answers.<p>

Another parameter you may find useful is <tt>dir</tt>.  If you assign a
value to it by typing<p>

<tt>| ?- set(dir,</tt><i>path_name</i><tt>).</tt><p>

then CCalc will <tt>loadf</tt> files from the directory specified by 
<i>path_name</i>, instead of the directory from which you started CCalc.<p>

Command <tt>reset_parameters</tt> restores all parameters to their default
values.<p>

Instead of changing the values of parameters by the <tt>set</tt> command,
you can copy the <tt>options.std</tt> file to the directory from which you
intend to start CCalc and modify that copy.<p>

<b>Exercise 1.5.</b>  Consider transition system
<a href="transitionsystems.html#boolean"><i>TS1</i></a>.  How many edges
ending at the vertex <i>p</i>=<b>t</b> are there in this graph?  Instruct
CCalc to calculate this
number on the basis of the <a href="input1.html#boolean">CCalc description</a>
of this transition system given in Section 1.1.<p>

<b>Exercise 1.6.</b>  How can we tell CCalc to find all vertices and all
edges of a given transition system?  Do this for the
<a href="input1.html#coins">CCalc description</a> of
<a href="transitionsystems.html#coins"><i>TS2</i></a>
shown at the end of Section 1.1 for <i>N</i>=3.<p>
