When an action domain is represented by a transition system, many
computational problems involving that domain can be stated as questions about
paths in this transition system.  This idea is used in the approach to
queries adopted in the input language of CCalc.<p>

Consider, for instance, several identical objects, say coins, and a box in
which these objects can be placed.  There is enough room in the box for
10 coins.  We are interested in the effect of the action <i>a</i> of putting
 a coin in the box on the number <i>c</i> of coins that are currently in the
box.  This domain can be represented by transition system
<a href="transitionsystems.html#coins"><i>TS2</i></a> (Section 0.1) with
<i>N</i>=10.<p>

<i>Prediction.</i>  Currently there are 5 coins in the box.  If I put one coin
in the box twice in a row, how many coins will there be in the box at the
end?<p>

In terms of paths in the transition system: consider the path of length 2 that
starts at the vertex <i>c</i>=5 and has both edges labeled <i>a</i>=<b>t</b>.
Where does it end? (Answer: <i>c</i>=7.)<p>

<i>Postdiction.</i>  I just put one coin in the box twice in a row, and now
there are 5 coins in it.  How many coins were there in the box initially?<p>

In terms of paths: consider the path of length 2 that ends at the vertex
<i>c</i>=5 and has both edges labeled <i>a</i>=<b>t</b>.  Where does it
start?  (Answer: <i>c</i>=3.)<p>

<i>Planning.</i>  Currently there are 4 coins in the box.  Find the shortest
sequence of events that will make the box full.<p>

In terms of paths: find the shortest path from the vertex <i>c</i>=4 to the
vertex <i>c</i>=10. (Answer: path of length 6 with every edge labeled
<i>a</i>=<b>t</b>.)<p>
