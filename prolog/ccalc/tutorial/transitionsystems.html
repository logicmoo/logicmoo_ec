CCalc is a program for solving computational problems related to action
and change.  Many problems of this kind can be described in terms of
"transition systems" -- directed graphs with vertices corresponding to
states, and edges corresponding to events.<p>

Consider, for instance, a system with 2 states defined by the value of a
Boolean-valued parameter ("fluent") <i>p</i>.  Executing action <i>a</i> causes
<i>p</i> to be true.  This system can be graphically represented as
follows:<br>

<a name="boolean">

<p>
We will refer to this transition system as <i>TS1</i>.
Its two edges labeled <i>a=</i><b>t</b> represent the events in which
action <i>a</i> is executed; these edges lead to the state <i>p=</i><b>t</b>.
The other two edges are labeled <i>a=</i><b>f</b> (action <i>a</i> is not
executed), so that these edges are loops.

<p>
If a system involves several fluents
<i>p</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>p</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>p</i><sub>3</sub>, ...
then every vertex is labeled by a set of equations specifying the values
of all fluents in the corresponding state, for instance:

<center>
<i>p</i><sub>1</sub>=<b>t</b>, <i>p</i><sub>2</sub>=<b>t</b>,
<i>p</i><sub>3</sub>=<b>f</b>, ... .
</center><p>

If there are several actions
<i>a</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>a</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>a</i><sub>3</sub>, ...
then every edge is labeled by a set of equations specifying which actions
are executed in the corresponding event, for instance:<p>

<center>
<i>a</i><sub>1</sub>=<b>t</b>, <i>a</i><sub>2</sub>=<b>t</b>,
<i>a</i><sub>3</sub>=<b>f</b>, ... .
</center><p>

Assigning the value <b>t</b> to several action symbols indicates that
the corresponding actions are executed concurrently.<p>

Besides Boolean-valued fluents, transition systems may include fluents with
any other values.  Consider, for instance, a fluent <i>c</i> that takes values
from an initial segment of nonnegative integers {0,...,<i>N</i>}.  Transition
system <i>TS2</i> below shows the effect of the action <i>a</i> that increments
<i>c</i> by 1 when <i>c</i><<i>N</i> and is nonexecutable otherwise.<br>
