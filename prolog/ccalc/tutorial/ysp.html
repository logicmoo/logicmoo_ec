2. Example: Yale Shooting Problem

<h2>
2.1. Basic Formulation
</h2>
</center>

The Yale Shooting Problem was introduced by
Steve Hanks and <a  href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/dvm/">Drew McDermott</a>
in 1987 (<i>Artificial Intelligence</i>, Vol. 33).  It is about a person
(according to other accounts, a
turkey) who at any point in time is either alive or dead, and about a gun that
can be either loaded or unloaded.  The gun becomes loaded any time a load
action is executed.  The person becomes dead any time he is shot with a loaded
gun.<p>

Assume that the person is initially alive.  The gun is loaded, then
he waits for a while, and then he is shot with the gun.  What can we say,
given these assumptions, about the values of the fluents involved --
<i>alive</i> and <i>loaded</i> -- at various points in time?<p>

The description of the domain above does not say whether the load action is
considered executable when the gun is already loaded.  Let's decide that the
answer is yes: when the gun is loaded, that action can be executed but will
have no effect.<p>

Note that the assumptions of the Yale Shooting Problem do not determine
the initial state completely: the fluent <i>loaded</i> can be either true
or false in the initial state.  But once the initial value of this fluent is
selected, all future changes in the values of fluents are uniquely defined.<p>

The shooting domain can be described in the language of CCalc by the following
declarations and propositions:

<pre>
:- constants
 loaded, alive :: inertialFluent;
 load, shoot   :: exogenousAction.

load causes loaded.

shoot causes -alive.
shoot causes -loaded.
nonexecutable shoot if -loaded.

nonexecutable load & shoot.
</pre>

The declarations of the two fluent constants are combined here into one, and
so are the declarations of the two action constants.  The last line expresses
the assumption (implicit in the informal description of the domain) that the
two actions cannot be executed concurrently.<p>

The corresponding transition system has 4 vertices:<p>

<center>
<i>alive</i>=<b>f</b>,&nbsp;<i>loaded</i>=<b>f</b><br>
<i>alive</i>=<b>f</b>,&nbsp;<i>loaded</i>=<b>t</b><br>
<i>alive</i>=<b>t</b>,&nbsp;<i>loaded</i>=<b>f</b><br>
<i>alive</i>=<b>t</b>,&nbsp;<i>loaded</i>=<b>t</b><br>
</center>

<p>Its edges are labeled by 3 events:<p>

<center>
<i>load</i>=<b>f</b>,&nbsp;<i>shoot</i>=<b>f</b><br>
<i>load</i>=<b>f</b>,&nbsp;<i>shoot</i>=<b>t</b><br>
<i>load</i>=<b>t</b>,&nbsp;<i>shoot</i>=<b>f</b><br>
</center>

<p><b>Exercise 2.1.</b>
How many edges do you think this transition system has?  Verify your
answer using CCalc.<p>

Expressing the assumptions about the sequence of events in the Yale
Shooting Problem (load, then wait, then shoot) by a CCalc query can be made
easier by introducing the macro

<pre>
:- macros
 wait -> -load & -shoot.
</pre>

(to wait means not to load and not to shoot).  Then we can write:

<pre>
:- query
 maxstep:: 3;
 0: alive;
 0: load;
 1: wait;
 2: shoot.
</pre>

<b>Exercise 2.2.</b>
Run CCalc to verify that this query has exactly two answers, as expected.<p>

The examination of the answers to the query above shows that, in each of
them, the fluent <i>alive</i> is false at step 3.  In this sense, the
assumptions of the Yale Shooting Problem entail the conclusion that this
fluent eventually becomes false.  An alternative way to verify this
conclusion is to instruct CCalc to answer the query in which this conclusion
is required not to hold:

<pre>
:- query
 maxstep:: 3;
 0: alive;
 0: load;
 1: wait;
 2: shoot;
 3: alive.
</pre>

CCalc will determine that these assumptions are inconsistent.<p>

<b>Exercise 2.3.</b>
Use CCalc to check that the assumption 0:<i>-alive</i> entails
10:<i>-alive</i>.<p>

<b>Exercise 2.4.</b>
Modify the original formalization of the Yale Shooting Problem to reflect
the assumption that the shoot action is executable even when the gun is
not loaded, but it does not affect the fluent <i>alive</i> in this case.
How does this modification affect the number of edges  of the transition
system, in your opinion?  Verify your answer using CCalc.<p>

<b>Exercise 2.5.</b>
In the modification of the Yale Shooting Problem introduced by Andrew Baker
in 1991 (<i>Artificial Intelligence</i>, Vol. 49) and known as the Stanford
Murder Mystery, the person is alive initially, but is found to be
dead after a wait followed by shooting.  Using CCalc, check under these
assumptions that the gun was initially loaded.<p>

Instead of defining <tt>wait</tt> as an abbreviation, we can treat this
symbol as a third action constant.  The assumption that no two actions out of
3 can be executed concurrently requires 3 propositions:

<pre>
nonexecutable load & shoot.
nonexecutable load & wait.
nonexecutable shoot & wait.
</pre>

The language of CCalc allows us to express the no concurrency assumption
more concisely, simply by writing

<pre>
noconcurrency.
</pre>
