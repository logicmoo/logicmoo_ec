rule(R).
  asserts either a rule of the form H :- B or an atom.
H <- B. 
   is the same as rule((H :- B)). 
   Rules with empty bodies (facts) must be written as H <- true. or as rule(H).
random([h1:p1,...,hn:pn]).
   declares the hi to be pairwise disjoint hypotheses, with P(hi)=pi. 
random(X,h,[x1:p1,...,xn:pn]).
   declares h[X/xi] to be pairwise disjoint hypotheses with P(h[X/xi])=pi.
controllable([h1,...,hn]).
   declares the hi to be pairwise disjoint controllable variables.
explain(G,C). 
   finds explanations of G given list of controlling values C.
how(G,C,N).
   is used to explain the Nth explanation of G given C.
diff(G,C,N,M) 
   prints difference in the proof tree for the Nth and Mth explanation of G 
   given C.
check(G,C).
   checks for disjoint rules in the explanations of G given C.
recap(G). 
   recaps the explanations of G, with posterior probabilities (given G).
recap. 
   gives the prior probabilities of everything explained.
thcons(filename). 
   loads a file called filename. 
tracing(F). 
    sets tracing to have status F which is one of {yes,no}.
help.
    print this message.
