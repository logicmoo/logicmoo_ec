   ABDUCTIVE EVENT CALCULUS

   MURRAY SHANAHAN

   Version 1.15

   July 1998

   Written for LPA MacProlog 32

*/


/*
   This is an abductive meta-interpreter for abduction with negation-as-
   failure, with built-in features for handling event calculus queries.
   In effect this implements a partial-order planner. not(clipped) facts
   correspond to protected links. The planner will also perform
   hierarchical decomposition, given definitions of compound events
   (happens if happens clauses).

   The form of queries is as follows.

        abdemo(Goals, Residue)

   Goals is a list of atoms. Residue is a pair of [RH, RB], where RH is a
   list of happens facts and RB is a list of temporal ordering facts.
   Negations is a list of lists of atoms.

   Roughly speaking, the above formulae should hold if,

        EC and CIRC[Domain] and CIRC[ResidueOut] |= Goals

   where EC is the event calculus axioms, CIRC[Domain] is the completion
   of initiates, terminates and  releases, and CIRC[ResidueOut] is the
   completion of happens. (Note that completion isn't applied to temporal
   ordering facts.)

   F is expected to be fully bound when we call abdemo(holds_at(F, T)).
   It's assumed that all primitive actions (two argument happens) are
   in the residue (ie: none are in the program).

   Although the interpreter will work with any logic program, the axioms of
   the event calculus are compiled in to the meta-level.

   The function symbol "neg" is introduced to represent classically
   negated fluents. holds_at(neg(F)) corresponds to not holds_at(F)
   (with classical "not"). terminates formulae play a role in clipping
   positive fluents and initiating negative fluents. Conversely,
   initiates formulae play a role in clipping negative fluents and
   initiating positive ones.

   Computation interleaves search (abdemo) and refinement phases. After each
   step of the computation, where a step is an iteration of abdemo or a
   refinement, the residue so far plus the remaining goal list entail the goal
   state. In other words, these computational steps are also proof steps.

   An iterative deepening search strategy is employed, where depth
   corresponds to length of plan.
*/




/* TOP LEVEL */


/*
   Top level calls to abdemo have to be transformed to the following form.

        abdemo_top(Goals, ResidueIn, ResidueOut, NegationsIn, NegationsOut, DepthBound)

   The residue has the form [[HA, HC], [BA, BC]], where HA is a list of happens
   atoms, HC is the transistive closure of the before-or-equal relation on times
   that follows from HA, BA is a list of before atoms, and BC is the transitive
   closure of BA.

/* REFINE */


/*
   refine(R1, N1, Gs, R2, N2) takes the earliest compound action out of the residue
   R1 and puts it in the goal list Gs, along with all "before", not(clipped) and
   not(declipped) facts that refer to the same time points. These time points
   are unskolemised, so that they can be bound to existing time points in the
   residue, thus permitting sub-actions to be shared between abstract actions.
   This almost restores the state of computation to the state S before the chosen
   action was added to the residue in the first place. But not quite, because
   some derived before facts will be retained in the transitive closure part
   of the before part of the residue that weren't there in state S. This doesn't
   matter, however, because these derived facts will need to be there eventually
   anyway, when those before facts that have been transferred from residue to goal
   list get put back in the residue.

   The compound action extracted from the residue is marked for expansion by
   inserting it in the goal list in the form expand([happens(A, T1, T2)|Bs]),
   where Bs is the list of "before" facts taken out of the residue, as
   described above. When abdemo comes across a goal of this form, it will
   resolve the "happens" part against program clauses. The reason for
   not doing this resolution here is that we want to backtrack to alternative
   definitions of a compound goal inside the iterative deepening search, not
   outside it. This ensures the desired behaviour for compound actions which
   expand to one series of sub-actions given certain conditions but to another
   series of sub-actions given other conditions. Otherwise the check for these
   conditions, which will be a holds_at goal in the compound action definition,
   is in danger of being treated as a goal to be established instead of just
   checked.
