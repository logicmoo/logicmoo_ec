/*
Most animals can compare natural numbers. But counting is a "behavoviour script" that comes from playing a game with words. 
That game requires using language.  
Until such a game is played it is very unlikely to expect these numbers belong in a "numerical order".
Most animals (including bees) can see the numerical difference between the natural numbers 
(though bees are born with language with syntax and smeantic rules).
*/
%"Language" is a system that allows thoughts to be turned into a low mental bandwith immediate thoughtform.  Buffered in suchb a way that when echo'd a new unrelated thoughtform can take place
